## What Is MemeCoin?

**MemeCoin** is a decentralized application (dApp) that lets users:

- Launch their own meme-based tokens.
- Automatically list tokens into a liquidity pool governed by a bonding curve.
- Eliminate rug-pulls by locking liquidity from the start.
- Prevent whale dominance by enforcing distribution rules.
- Stop spam coins by adding creation constraints.

> “In a world full of rug pulls, be the meme with a meaning.” — The MemeCoin Philosophy
